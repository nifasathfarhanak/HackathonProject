# How TCGS is Different from Existing Solutions

| Feature                  | 1. Manual Process                                                                                             | 2. Generic AI Chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT)                                                                                                                            | 3. Our TCGS Prototype                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compliance Awareness** | ⚠️ **Human-Dependent.** Relies entirely on the engineer's memory and diligence. Inconsistent and hard to scale. | ❌ **None.** Has no access to your private, internal compliance documents (SOPs) or specific purchased standards (ISO, IEC). Provides generic answers, not auditable ones. | ✅ **Purpose-Built & Auditable.** Its core is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) engine connected directly to **your** specific compliance documents. Every test case is grounded in your actual source of truth.                               |
| **Automated RTM**        | ❌ **Fully Manual.** Requires QA to manually create and maintain separate RTM spreadsheets, a slow and tedious process. | ❌ **Impossible.** Cannot create a traceability matrix to documents it has never seen.                                                                                   | ✅ **Fully Automated.** The AI is explicitly instructed to generate the `rtm_compliance_mapping` for every test case, creating the traceability link automatically.                                                                         |
| **Context Understanding**  | ⚠️ **Inconsistent.** A human understands the context, but this understanding varies from person to person and day to day. | ❌ **General, Not Specific.** Understands language but lacks the specific context of your project, your company's internal processes, and your specific regulatory interpretations. | ✅ **Deep & Specific.** Combines the general intelligence of the Gemini LLM with the deep, specific context retrieved from your private knowledge base. It understands what a requirement means *for your project*.                                |
| **Enterprise Integration** | ⚠️ **Manual.** Requires slow, error-prone copy-pasting of data into Jira or other tools.                       | ❌ **None.** Completely disconnected from your development toolchain.                                                                                                   | ✅ **Seamless & Automated.** Designed with a dedicated `alm_integrator` module to push fully detailed test cases, including the RTM, directly into Jira with a single click.                                                                    |
| **Control & Customization**| ✅ **Full Control.** The process is fully controlled by your internal team.                                         | ❌ **No Control.** You are using a public, third-party service with no control over its logic, data privacy, or availability.                                          | ✅ **Full Control.** This is your system. It is built on standard, flexible components (Python, Flask, Google Cloud). You have full control over the AI's logic, the data, and which tools it integrates with.                                      |
